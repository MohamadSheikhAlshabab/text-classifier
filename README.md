# Lab: Machine Learning Intro

- Reading the mood from text with machine learning is called sentiment analysis, and it is one of the prominent use cases in text classification. 
- This falls into the very active research field of natural language processing (NLP).
- Other common use cases of text classification include detection of spam, auto tagging of customer queries, and categorization of text into defined topics.
- So how can you do this?

## Overview

A key developer skill is the ability to use internet resources effectively. Especially when learning a new topic.

For this lab you’ll be converting an excellent tutorial from a couple years ago. Does it still work? Let’s find out!

NOTE: you don’t have to understand all of the code in the tutorial yet. Get it working first, in the process it will become more familiar.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

Your task is to convert Practical Text Classification With Python and Keras tutorial into a running Jupyter Notebook.
To accomplish your primary task you’ll need install several libraries and external assets.
A big part of this lab is building resilience when faced with an incomplete solution.
Because most of the time that’s what internet is going to give you.

## Implementation Notes

Your project will require several dependencies to be installed. Figure out which ones.
Your project will require downloading external assets to particular locations, and with particular names.
Some example code may cause errors. Troubleshoot the errors and see if you can fix them.
Hint - you can
